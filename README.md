Follow these steps to create a simple A/B test. 
An A/B test is a randomized experiment using two or more variants of the same web page (A and B). Variant A is the original and variant B through n each contain at least one element that is modified from the original.

Prerequisites
Create an A/B test

In this experiment, we’ll test changing the color of a button:

    Go to your Optimize Account (Main menu > Accounts).
    Click on your Container name to get to the Experiments page.
    Click CREATE EXPERIMENT.
    Enter an Experiment name (up to 255 characters).
    Enter an Editor page URL (the web page you'd like to test).
    Click A/B test.
    Click CREATE.

The variants card

The top of the experiment page includes the variants card. This where you'll create the specific changes to your web page that you wish to test, called variants. You can create as many variants as you wish to test against your original page (the Editor page in Optimize).
Create a variant

To get started, click CREATE VARIANT (bottom right), enter a variant name, then click ADD. Repeat this process to create additional variants. When finished, you'll see a list of your new variants on the variants card.

To start making changes. click anywhere in the variant row (which will say "0 changes"). This will launch the Optimize visual editor – an overlay on top of your editor page consisting of two components: the app bar (at the top of the page) and the editor panel (floating in the lower right).

Start editing:

    Click on any web page element you wish to edit (e.g. a button).
    Use the editor panel to make a change (e.g. change the button color).
    Click SAVE.
    Continue making edits as necessary.
    Click DONE.

Start your experiment

Click START EXPERIMENT. When the status field says "running," your experiment is live on the web. Most updates happen within a minute.
How long should your experiment run?

Keep an experiment running until at least one of these conditions has been met:

    Two weeks have passed, to account for cyclical variations in web traffic during the week.
    At least one variant has a 95 percent probability to beat baseline.

Experience management options

Optimize provides several ways to manage your experiences, whether in draft, running, or ended status. This article explains how to search inside containers and how to access functions like edit, copy, stop, and archive.
Reports

To monitor a running experiment or see the results of a concluded experiment, click the Reporting tab at the top of the experiment detail page. The report is broken down into a series of cards that contain data about your experiment, including its status and how your variants perform against your objectives.

In addition to the reports included in Optimize, you can also see Optimize reports in Google Analytics. Sign in to Google Analytics, select the Reporting tab and select Behavior > Experiments in the report navigation. Learn more about Optimize reports.
