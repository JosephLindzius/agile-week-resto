# About FoodieFinder
 is a very useful web page that returns the best restaurants in a city of your choice, respecting one of the restaurants catagories in the dropdown menue.
 

## Idea
The idea came to us because we are a foodie team, we love food. One day we were thinking of going out to eat, it's for sure posiible that you search for that information on google but what if you want to be fast and specifick in one kind of food or restaurant. With this website you will for sure not lose that much of time.

## Bugs: 
Unfortunatly we didnt find all the API's that has all the data we needed to cover all the cities around the world!
Probably when we expand in our buisness we will be able to manage getting the right data with a payable amount of money.

## A/B test
we have manged to do the (A/B) test to run our project in order to  make the best choices to our future users.
